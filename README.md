The Student Result Management System (SRMS) is a fully functional, demo web application built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to manage and display student data, marks, and results in an interactive and visually appealing way.
This project showcases my SQL and database management skills, including:
Designing and structuring MySQL databases for students, subjects, and results.
Writing complex SQL queries for retrieving and joining data across multiple tables.
Implementing dynamic data handling using PHP and SQL integration.
Performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a secure and structured way.

Features:
Add Student: Insert new student details (demo version).
View Students: Display all students with attributes like Roll No, Name, Age, and City.
Add Marks: Enter marks for subjects like Python, SQL, and Data Science topics (demo interactive form).
View Results: See subject-wise marks and overall statistics, including total, average, and highest marks.
Class Topper: Automatically calculate and display the highest-scoring student.
Interactive UI: Modern, AI-style dashboard with visually appealing tables, badges for skills (Python/SQL/JS), and circular progress indicators.

Tech Stack:
Backend: PHP, MySQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: MySQL for structured student and results data
Purpose:

This project demonstrates my database design, SQL query writing, and PHP integration skills in a real-world student management scenario.
It is suitable for showcasing in portfolios, GitHub, or during interviews for Data Science or Web Development role
